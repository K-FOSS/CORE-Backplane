# CORE-Backplane KeyDB/Redis

[KeyDB]() is a [Redis]() and memcached compatible FOSS service that is much easier to cluster, and much more thorugh controls around multi tenancy.

We currently manually "use" 3 "databases" and these are due to the applications they are used being critical to the deployment and maintence of the KeyDB system and everything else

Further usage relies upon ArgoCD, Database Operator, KeyDB, TwemProxy, OAM/KubeVela, and Crossplane ****TODO: Make that stuff****
